# Manga CLI Reader

This is a CLI tool that uses the MangaDex API to retrieve manga chapters and read them using **YACReader**.

## Dependencies
- YACReader

## Planned features
I’ll keep adding features to improve the app:

- Next/previous page navigation for chapters and search results
- Local database to save downloaded manga
- Send-to-Kindle support (connect Kindle and download directly)
- TUI (terminal user interface)

## Notes
This is my first project, so please be kind :p
